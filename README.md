Completed on: (I took my time to go through the materials and complete the course. I loved it and would recommend that you take the time to grind it through the problem sets!)

I create this repository to store my solutions and document my progress for [CS50x Intro to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020) by Harvard. I hope you enjoy the course as much as I did and may these solutions help you out as well! Do make sure that you run through the solutions yourself and understand the code as well before copying it!
